# Esther's craft log

This is my personal craft log, where I keep a record of my yarn creations.

It was made to look somewhat similar to an Instagram profile page, with none of the extra social media noise; reminiscent of the older days, when the Internet was more about personal blogs and websites. I like to be in control of where my creations are hosted, and to not be dependent on any social media platform.

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
